## Overview
The second project in The odin Project curriculum. This project was cumulative, covering all previous
topics and recent ones up to Flexbox. This project focused primarily on creating dynamic layouts using 
flexbox. 

## Reflection
I had great practice utilizing the workflow of git and writing useful commit messages.
A major aspect I tried to focus on was making atomic commits, in this case,
I made a commit everytime I finished a section of the page, but this can be broken
down into smaller commits. At one point, I was unsatisfied with my HTML structure so
I tried starting over from a previous commit, but instead of creating a separate branch
or reverting, I used hard reset. I could have handled that better so I will need to learn
more about reverting.
